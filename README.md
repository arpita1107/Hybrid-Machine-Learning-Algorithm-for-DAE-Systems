# Hybrid-Machine-Learning-Algorithm-for-DAE-Systems

In this work, a hybrid machine learning algorithm was developed for the DAE systems. It takes into account the effect of varying parameters in the measurement model. This measurement model mismatch results in a bias between the estimator predictions and the actual plant dynamics. It can lead to incorrect estimations of the state variables and hence reduced operational efficiency and increased production costs. 

The performance of the hybrid machine learning approach is studied using a standard Nickel-hydroxide electrode model. In this case study, rate of change of mole fraction is the differential state and potential difference between the interfaces is the algebraic state. The goal of this study was to estimate these state variables effectively, close to the actual state of the system.
